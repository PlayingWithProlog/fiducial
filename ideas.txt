- Graphs
- Dynamic Book
- Living Recipe
- Train tracks  (slot car track?)
- Pipe connection
- start webservice an plug together
- factory/constraints - move stuff around in factory, id constraints not satisfied
- projector and camera on the top makes things mechanically easier
- education - demo population dynamics with an interactive graph, using labview type cardboard instruments
- cardboard instruments - like labview
- geometric constraints - hold projection on a constraint
- connection constraint - 

The TUI should be presented with 3 videos
1. Justify
2. Demo
3. Tutorial
